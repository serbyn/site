Alex arrived to IST in December of 2017 after a short postdoctoral appointment at University of Leeds. He is mainly interested in ergodicity breaking non-equilibrium quantum dynamics. He applies a variety of numerical and analytical tools to study dynamical properties of many-body localized systems, models with a large mismatch of dynamical timescales, and kinematically constrained models.
