Anna is visiting IST from the University of Geneva where she is pursuing her PhD degree. Anna is interested in non-equilibrium properties of low-dimensional quantum systems. During her visit, Anna is working on the dynamical responses of many-body localized phase and properties of many-body delocalization transition. Some results of this work are summarized in recent preprints, see Publications.
