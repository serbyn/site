We are looking for physicists interested in quantum condensed matter, quantum many-body physics, quantum information, and/or numerical methods. If you are interested in joining us, see details below.
- **Postdocs**: at the moment there are *no open positions*. We expect the next opening to become available in September 2025.  
- **PhD students**: We are looking to admit one graduate student next year. IST has a US-style graduate school with centralized admission. The next application deadline around 1st of January 2025. Please submit your application via [graduate school](https://phd.pages.ist.ac.at/phd-application-admission/) in due time. 
- **Interns**: At the moment all internship positions in our group are filled. However, IST offers an internship program called “ISTernship” during the summer. If you are approaching the end of your undergraduate/masters studies, and would like to spend a summer of 2018 at IST working on scientific project, please apply here. Due to summer travel, the preference will be given to interns who can start in May/early June.
