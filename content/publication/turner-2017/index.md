abstract: The thermodynamic description of many-particle systems rests on the assumption
  of ergodicity, the ability of a system to explore all allowed configurations in
  the phase space. Recent studies on many-body localization have revealed the existence
  of systems that strongly violate ergodicity in the presence of quenched disorder.
  Here, we demonstrate that ergodicity can be weakly broken by a different mechanism,
  arising from the presence of special eigenstates in the many-body spectrum that
  are reminiscent of quantum scars in chaotic non-interacting systems. In the single-particle
  case, quantum scars correspond to wavefunctions that concentrate in the vicinity
  of unstable periodic classical trajectories. We show that many-body scars appear
  in the Fibonacci chain, a model with a constrained local Hilbert space that has
  recently been experimentally realized in a Rydberg-atom quantum simulator. The quantum
  scarred eigenstates are embedded throughout the otherwise thermalizing many-body
  spectrum but lead to direct experimental signatures, as we show for periodic recurrences
  that reproduce those observed in the experiment. Our results suggest that scarred
  many-body bands give rise to a new universality class of quantum dynamics, opening
  up opportunities for the creation of novel states with long-lived coherence in systems
  that are now experimentally realizable.
