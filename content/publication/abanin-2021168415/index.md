abstract: We re-examine attempts to study the many-body localization transition using
  measures that are physically natural on the ergodic/quantum chaotic regime of the
  phase diagram. Using simple scaling arguments and an analysis of various models
  for which rigorous results are available, we find that these measures can be particularly
  adversely affected by the strong finite-size effects observed in nearly all numerical
  studies of many-body localization. This severely impacts their utility in probing
  the transition and the localized phase. In light of this analysis, we discuss a
  recent study (Å untajs et al., 2020) of the behaviour of the Thouless energy and
  level repulsion in disordered spin chains, and its implications for the question
  of whether MBL is a true phase of matter.
