abstract: Thermalization is the inevitable fate of many complex quantum systems, whose
  dynamics allow them to fully explore the vast configuration space regardless of
  the initial state---the behaviour known as quantum ergodicity. In a quest for experimental
  realizations of coherent long-time dynamics, efforts have focused on ergodicity-breaking
  mechanisms, such as integrability and localization. The recent discovery of persistent
  revivals in quantum simulators based on Rydberg atoms have pointed to the existence
  of a new type of behaviour where the system rapidly relaxes for most initial conditions,
  while certain initial states give rise to non-ergodic dynamics. This collective
  effect has been named `quantum many-body scarring'by analogy with a related form
  of weak ergodicity breaking that occurs for a single particle inside a stadium billiard
  potential. In this Review, we provide a pedagogical introduction to quantum many-body
  scars and highlight the emerging connections with the semiclassical quantization
  of many-body systems. We discuss the relation between scars and more general routes
  towards weak violations of ergodicity due to embedded algebras and non-thermal eigenstates,
  and highlight possible applications of scars in quantum technology.
