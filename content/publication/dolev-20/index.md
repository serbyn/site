abstract: Large-scale systems comprising one-dimensional chains and two-dimensional
  arrays of excited atoms held in a programmable optical lattice are a powerful platform
  with which to simulate emergent phenomena. Bluvstein et al. built an array of up
  to 200 Rydberg atoms and subjected the system to periodic excitation. Under such
  driven excitation, they found that the array of atoms stabilized, freezing periodically
  into what looked like time crystals. Understanding and controlling the dynamic interactions
  in quantum many-body systems lies at the heart of contemporary condensed matter
  physics and the exotic phenomena that can occur.Science, this issue p. 1355The control
  of nonequilibrium quantum dynamics in many-body systems is challenging because interactions
  typically lead to thermalization and a chaotic spreading throughout Hilbert space.
  We investigate nonequilibrium dynamics after rapid quenches in a many-body system
  composed of 3 to 200 strongly interacting qubits in one and two spatial dimensions.
  Using a programmable quantum simulator based on Rydberg atom arrays, we show that
  coherent revivals associated with so-called quantum many-body scars can be stabilized
  by periodic driving, which generates a robust subharmonic response akin to discrete
  time-crystalline order. We map Hilbert space dynamics, geometry dependence, phase
  diagrams, and system-size dependence of this emergent phenomenon, demonstrating
  new ways to steer complex dynamics in many-body systems and enabling potential applications
  in quantum information science.
