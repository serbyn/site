abstract: Ferromagnetism is most common in transition metal compounds where electrons
  occupy highly localized d orbitals. However, ferromagnetic order may also arise
  in low-density two-dimensional electron systems1--5. Here we show that gate-tuned
  van Hove singularities in rhombohedral trilayer graphene6 drive spontaneous ferromagnetic
  polarization of the electron system into one or more spin and valley flavours. Using
  capacitance and transport measurements, we observe a cascade of transitions tuned
  to the density and electronic displacement field between phases in which quantum
  oscillations have fourfold, twofold or onefold degeneracy, associated with a spin-
  and valley-degenerate normal metal, spin-polarized `half-metal', and spin- and valley-polarized
  `quarter-metal', respectively. For electron doping, the salient features of the
  data are well captured by a phenomenological Stoner model7 that includes valley-anisotropic
  interactions. For hole filling, we observe a richer phase diagram featuring a delicate
  interplay of broken symmetries and transitions in the Fermi surface topology. Finally,
  we introduce a moirésuperlattice using a rotationally aligned hexagonal boron nitride
  substrate5,8. Remarkably, we find that the isospin order is only weakly perturbed,
  with the moirépotential catalysing the formation of topologically nontrivial gapped
  states whenever itinerant half- or quarter-metal states occur at half- or quarter-superlattice
  band filling. Our results show that rhombohedral graphene is an ideal platform for
  well-controlled tests of many-body theory, and reveal magnetism in moirématerials4,5,9,10
  to be fundamentally itinerant in nature.
