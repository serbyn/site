abstract: The tunability of topological surface states and controllable opening of
  the Dirac gap are of fundamental and practical interest in the field of topological
  materials. In the newly discovered topological crystalline insulators (TCIs), theory
  predicts that the Dirac node is protected by a crystalline symmetry and that the
  surface state electrons can acquire a mass if this symmetry is broken. Recent studies
  have detected signatures of a spontaneously generated Dirac gap in TCIs; however,
  the mechanism of mass formation remains elusive. In this work, we present scanning
  tunnelling microscopy (STM) measurements of the TCI Pb1âˆ’xSnxSe for a wide range
  of alloy compositions spanning the topological and non-topological regimes. The
  STM topographies reveal a symmetry-breaking distortion on the surface, which imparts
  mass to the otherwise massless Dirac electrons---a mechanism analogous to the long
  sought-after Higgs mechanism in particle physics. Interestingly, the measured Dirac
  gap decreases on approaching the trivial phase, whereas the magnitude of the distortion
  remains nearly constant. Our data and calculations reveal that the penetration depth
  of Dirac surface states controls the magnitude of the Dirac mass. At the limit of
  the critical composition, the penetration depth is predicted to go to infinity,
  resulting in zero mass, consistent with our measurements. Finally, we discover the
  existence of surface states in the non-topological regime, which have the characteristics
  of gapped, double-branched Dirac fermions and could be exploited in realizing superconductivity
  in these materials.
