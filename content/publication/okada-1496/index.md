abstract: Certain materials, such as topological crystalline insulators (TCIs), host
  robust surface states that have a Dirac (graphene-like) dispersion associated with
  massless carriers; the breaking of protective symmetry within such materials should
  cause the carriers to acquire mass. Okada et al. (p. 1496, published online 29 August)
  used scanning tunneling microscopy to map out the energies of the electronic levels
  of the TCI Pb1-xSnxSe as a function of the strength of an external magnetic field.
  The massless Dirac fermions coexisted with massive ones, presumably as a consequence
  of a distortion of the crystalline structure affecting only one of the two mirror
  symmetries.In topological crystalline insulators (TCIs), topology and crystal symmetry
  intertwine to create surface states with distinct characteristics. The breaking
  of crystal symmetry in TCIs is predicted to impart mass to the massless Dirac fermions.
  Here, we report high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy studies of a TCI,
  Pb1-xSnxSe that reveal the coexistence of zero-mass Dirac fermions protected by
  crystal symmetry with massive Dirac fermions consistent with crystal symmetry breaking.
  In addition, we show two distinct regimes of the Fermi surface topology separated
  by a Van-Hove singularity at the Lifshitz transition point. Our work paves the way
  for engineering the Dirac band gap and realizing interaction-driven topological
  quantum phenomena in TCIs.
