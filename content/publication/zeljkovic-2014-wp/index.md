abstract: In crystalline topological insulators, the combination of an insulating
  bulk with conducting surface states is due to particular crystal symmetry. The associated
  Dirac cones---linear crossings in the electronic band structure---exhibit non-trivial
  orbital textures that have now been probed by means of scanning tunnelling spectroscopy.
